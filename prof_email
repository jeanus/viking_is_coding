Yeah , I agree with Huan. I haven't seen paper adopting Translation models to do recommendation yet. As we discussed in last meeting, social recommendation is simplified  HIN. We can try to extend it to HIN. One observation is either rating or friendship is direct relation between user and item or user and user and currently Translation model is only modelling direction relation. As in HIN, we user metapath or metagraph to calculate the similarity between user and item and user and item are normally not directly connected to each other, instead they connect to each other by a path or graph. I think we can study how to extend Translation model to model indirect connection/relationship here and this is a good start to apply Translation model to do recommendation in HIN.  
	
Also, as discussed with Huan. GAN(Generative adversarial networks) also deserves a try in recommendation. He shared me with this paper accepted by SIGIR 2017 : IRGAN: A Minimax Game for Unifying Generative and Discriminative Information Retrieval Models. You can take a look (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10513)

At this moment, I don't have any thing.
