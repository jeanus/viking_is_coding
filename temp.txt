Hi Connie,

    How are you ? I am Hao Ge. I graduated last year around May 2016 with Mphil degree supervised by Professor Dik-Lun Lee. But I was admitted in September 2013 as PhD student. Now I am working in HK holding an IANG visa and plan to apply for part-time PhD program supervised by Professor Dik-Lun Lee.
	In around June, Professor Huamin Qu took me to your office for several enquiries about part-time PhD application. Hope you could help to confirm with below,

		1. How to apply for CSE part-time PhD program? What are the deadlines ? 

		2. Do I need to take more English Test,likeTofel, IELTS for application ?

		3. I have finished all PhD courses during 2013 to 2016. Do I need to take any more courses then ?
	
	
Thanks
Hao Ge
